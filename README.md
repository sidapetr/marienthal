# Marienthal workshop app

This school project aims to introduce an online application for division of students into workshop groops.

## Current practice:

The St. Marienthal intercultural seminar constists of several workshops with certain capacities. Student from 8 european countries are coming to work together on the seminar topic. They have to apply for workshop using a paper form (questionaire). Workshop leaders then divide students into their worksop.

## Issue

Students are divided into groups on 2nd day of the seminar. That leads to problem with preparation of workshops. For instance musicians should bring their instruments - they must be aware of being a part of their workshop group before leaving their homes.
